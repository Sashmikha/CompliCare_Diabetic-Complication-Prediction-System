# CompliCare_Diabetic-Complication-Prediction-System
CompliCare is a diabetic complication prediction system developed to assist medical professionals in predicting six diabetic complications which are retinopathy, IHD, CeVD, nephropathy, diabetic foot ulcer and amputation. It also includes a Descriptive Analytics Dashboard for medical professionals to find any trends or patterns that may help them in handling any diabetic complication related issues.

The system is developed using multi-label classification, which allows users to predict more than one complication at the same time or for the same patient. The tools used for model development are Google Colab and Python, whereas the website development is done using Streamlit. 

Due to university limitations, I am unable to disclose the project code. However, feel free to watch the demo video and please do not hesitate to reach out to me for futher information at n.sashmikha@gmail.com.
